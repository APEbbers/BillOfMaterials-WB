# Bill of Materials-WB

A workbench to create Bill of Materials (BoM) independent of the assembly workbench of your choice.
The following types of BoM can be created:
* a total BoM with all the parts and subassemblies (the deepest level can be set).
* a summary BoM.
* a parts only BoM.
* a first level BoM (useful for drawings).
* a raw BoM. (This is a BoM, just as is. No summation of parts and assemblies. Can be used for testing or creating your own BoM in programs like Excel or OpenOffice.)

## Supported assembly types:
* a2plus
* Assembly 3
* Assembly 4
* Internal assembly workbench (This workbench is still under development)
* Applink / ApplinkGroup assemblies
* AppPart assemblies
* Multi body parts (Part/Part Design)
